# AutoFlashcardQuizletCreator

The aim of the project is to facilitate the creation of Flashcards using the Quizlet website. Searching the internet I found that there is no such program and creating fiches for learning English is a breakneck job that can often take many hours. This programme can speed up the process considerably without much effort just by writing the vocabulary you want to translate.

# Acquisition of definitions and examples

The first file called [1 Cambridge webscraping.ipynb](https://github.com/Jkfre247/auto-flashcard-Quizlet-creator/blob/main/1%20Cambridge%20webscraping.ipynb) loads our txt file in which we have our vocabulary. In my case the txt file is called [words.txt](https://github.com/Jkfre247/auto-flashcard-Quizlet-creator/blob/main/words.txt). It goes through each word available extracting the definition and usage examples using the scraping process from the cambridge dictionary all depending on the availability and correctness of the word. If the word is entered correctly it will retrieve the definition and examples. We get a finished file which will be used in the second section [gotowy.csv](https://github.com/Jkfre247/auto-flashcard-Quizlet-creator/blob/main/gotowy.csv).
